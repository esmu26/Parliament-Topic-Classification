        "## 1.1 Background\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*In the zambian parliment(National Assembly), responses to debates and proceedings cover a broad range of topics, reflecting the various funtions parliament, which include legislation,oversight, and representation.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*parliamentary debates are critical forums for discussing national issues, shaping policies, and making government decisions. The proceedings often generate vast amounts of unstructured text data. Manually categorizing these debates into specific topics is time-consuming and prone to human bias.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Automating this classification can:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Help journalists quickly find relevant content.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Assist political analysts in identfying trends over time.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Improve public accessibility and transparency in governance.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2 Business Objective\n",
        "*The primary goal is to **develop an NLP-based classification system** that automatically assigns topics to reponses in parliamentary debates and proceedings.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*This will:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- **Reduce time** required for manually for classification.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- **Increase accuracy** in topic labeling.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Enable **faster policy trend analysis**.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.3 Problem Statement\n",
        "*Parliamentary debate transcripts contains discussions on diverse topics such as healthcare, education, economy, environment, and security. currently, categorizing these reponses manually is resource-intensive. This project aims to apply **Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning** techniques to automatically classify debates responses into predefined topics, thereby improving accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in parliamentary data analysis.*\n",

        "\n",
        "*- Collecting and preprocessing parliamentary debate datasets.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Extracting relevant features from textual data.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Applying machine learning classification algorithms.*\n",

        "*- Evaluating model performance using accuracy , precision, recall, and F1-score.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Out-of-Scope**\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Sentiment analysis of responses.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Live real-time scraping (dataset will be static for this project).*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- multilingual processing (only English will be used unless otherwise specified ).*\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.5 Success Criteria\n",
        "*The project will be considered successful if:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*1. The classification model achieves **>= 80% accuracy**(or equivalent F1-score).*\n",
        "\n",
        "*2. The trained model can correctly classify **unseen parliamentary responses** into their relevant topics.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*3. The process is well-documented for reproducibility.*\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.6 Stakeholders\n",
        "*- **Researchers/ Analysts** - Need topic summaries for policy studies.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- **Journalists** - want quick access to debates on specific issues.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- **Parliament Staffs** - Require efficient records organization.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- **Public** - Desire transparency and easier navigation of proceedings.*\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.7 Constraints and Risks\n",
        "*- Limited availability of labeled parliamentary datasets.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Potential class imbalance (some topics may have fewer examples).*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Variation in speaking styles and vocabulary among members.*\n",

        "## 1.8 Assumptions\n",
        "*- Debate transcripts are in **English**.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*- Topic labels will be **predefined** and mutually exclusive.*\n",

        "*- Historical data will be representative of future debate reponses.*"
